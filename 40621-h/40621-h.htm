<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>


<p>When I began to write these stories about children
of all lands I had just returned from Europe
whither I journeyed with Marie and Ref. Maybe
you don't know Marie and Ref. I'll introduce them:
Please meet Marie, my very little daughter, and Ref,
my very big reflex camera.</p>

<p>These two are my helpers. Marie helps by being
a little girl who knows what other little girls like
and by telling me; and Ref helps by snapping pictures
of everything interesting that Marie and I
see on our travels. I couldn't get along without
them.</p>

<p>Several years have gone by since we started our
work together and Marie is a bigger girl&mdash;but Ref
hasn't changed one bit. Ref hasn't changed any
more than my interest in writing these books for
you. And I hope that <i>you</i> hope that I'll never change,
because I want to keep on writing until we'll have
no more countries to write about&mdash;unless, of course,
some one discovers a new country.</p>

<p>Even if a new country isn't discovered, we'll find
foreign children to talk about&mdash;maybe the children
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a></span>
in Mars! Who knows? Nobody. Not even Marie&mdash;and
Marie usually knows about most things. That's
the reason why, you see, though I sign myself</p>

<h2>TONY AND TINAS</h2>


<p>It was love at first sight.</p>

<p>It happened as Tony was sauntering
along a noisy street in Naples. One of the
noisiest, oldest, and dirtiest streets.</p>

<p>Cries, songs, laughter, scoldings filled the
air. And smells! But not the smell of roses.</p>

<p>Tony's brown hands were stuffed in his
ragged pockets. A never-mind whistle was
on his saucy lips.</p>

<p>But suddenly he stopped. He planted his
legs apart and stared. There, on the steps
of a church, she sat. Her beautiful, pitiful
brown eyes looked up at Tony.</p>

<p>She had a bewitching face. It was a white
face; thin and rather sad.</p>

<p>"Hungry?" asked Tony.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, without waiting for a reply, he
added, "Come along. I'll buy you something
to eat."</p>

<p>He jingled coins in his pockets. His
mouth curved at the corners. He had black
eyes and they gleamed.</p>

<p>They started off together, when, all at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
once, she stopped and would go no farther.</p>

<p>"Come," urged Tony. "Don't be afraid.
I have money. See? I begged it of the
Americans at the big hotel."</p>

<p>He drew the coins from his pocket and
showed them to her. But she only stood and
gazed at him with those mournful, brown
eyes. Tony's black ones snapped.</p>

<p>"Avanti! (Forward!)" he cried. "What
makes you stand like a donkey? See, I have
enough to buy you all the food you can eat.
I am clever."</p>

<p>He smiled roguishly.</p>

<p>"I cry before the foreigners," he continued.
"I rub my stomach, so! I say, 'Ah,
I die of hunger!'"</p>

<p>He made a frightful face and patted his
stomach.</p>

<p>But she only looked at him and did not
move. Yet there was admiration in her
eyes.</p>

<p>"Then," he went on, "they feel sorry for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
me and they say, 'Poor boy! Beautiful boy!
We must give him some money!' So they
do that!"</p>

<p>He laughed and showed his white teeth.
But not she. There was something very
serious about her.</p>

<p>Tony had a temper. Angrily, he now
stooped and picked her up. She did not resist.
In fact, her fluffy tail wagged heartily
and she began to lick his face.</p>

<p>She seemed to be saying, "I am forbidden
to go with you. But if you take me, what
can I do?"</p>

<p>Tony bought meat from a street vender.
He put her down and fed her out of his hand.
She ate hungrily. Her little ribs showed
plainly through the dirty white hair of her
body.</p>

<p>When she finished, Tony picked her up
again. He should have taken her back to
the church steps. She belonged to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
Marionette show around the corner. She
was a trained dog.</p>

<p>But Tony did not know this. He only
knew that he loved the little dog very much,
that he could not live another day without
her.</p>

<p>Determinedly, he tucked her under his
arm and started toward home.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>

<p>He stuffed the remaining meat inside his
shirt. It was not a very clean shirt, anyway,
so a little meat did not make much difference.</p>

<p>Tony was an orphan. Nobody ever said
to him, "Take your bath!" "Have you
washed your ears?"</p>

<p>He lived with an old woman in the back
of a very old house. Everything was old on
this street. Everything but the children&mdash;and
there were many of them.</p>

<p>It was a poor and crowded street. People
sat outside their doors all day long. They
worked and played and ate outside.</p>

<p>But now Tony ran inside quickly to look
for the old woman.</p>

<p>"Look! Look!" he cried. "I have found
a poor, lost little dog!"</p>

<p>The old woman was deaf.</p>

<p>"The dog is hurt?" she screamed. She
glared at the frightened animal which lay
quite still in Tony's arms.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>

<p>"No!" yelled Tony. "I found her and I
am going to keep her!"</p>

<p>"You are not going to keep her!" shrilled
the old woman.</p>

<p>Then she peered more closely at Tony.</p>

<p>"What is that?" she asked. "Ah, meat inside
your shirt! You have been feeding animals
again. Ah!"</p>

<p>Her mouth fell open. A light of recognition
came into her eyes.</p>

<p>"Dio Mio!" she gasped. "It is the trained
dog of Guido, the Marionette Man! You
have stolen it! Ah, Madonna, now you are
a thief!"</p>

<p>Tony shrank. His face grew almost as
white as the dog's. A thief! Of course,
Tony knew that often he did not tell the
truth. But then, it was sometimes much
easier to make up falsehoods. And much
more fun! Besides, he never told stories
that would do anyone harm.</p>

<p>But to steal? That was a different thing.</p>

<p>He had not known that the dog belonged to
the Marionette show.</p>

<p>"You are not satisfied with telling lies,"
went on the excited old woman. "But now
you must steal besides! Come, you child of
Satan!"</p>

<p>She threw a tattered shawl about her
shoulders.</p>

<p>"We are going to take the dog back to
Guido!" she announced.</p>

<p>She led Tony away briskly. She was a
witch-like old woman. But still, she had
cared for Tony since his parents had died
and left him alone.</p>

<p>She had cared for him in giving him a
home and something to eat. But that was
all. She had not tried to teach him the
things that real parents teach their children&mdash;things
like the beauty of truth. Perhaps
if she had done this, Tony might have
been different.</p>

<p>As it was, he was a lying little rascal with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
the face of an angel. He had no thought
but for song and story&mdash;and, of course, for
animals!</p>

<p>They found Guido at his tiny theatre.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
The old woman pushed Tony up to the Marionette
Man, the dog nestling in his arms.</p>

<p>"Here is your dog, Mr. Guido!" The old
woman's voice was sharp like her nose.
Tony, who liked beautiful sounds, hated to
hear her talk.</p>

<p>"This&mdash;this&mdash;lost child of a thousand
devils brought it home," she croaked.
"What will he do next? I am disgraced!"</p>

<p>Guido took the dog from Tony's arms.
Guido was dark and oily. He smiled. But
Tony did not smile. Two big tears stood in
his eyes. His rosy mouth did not curl. It
trembled.</p>

<p>"So you love my Tina very much, yes?"
asked Guido. He laid his hand on Tony's
little brown cap. "You would like to own
her, eh?"</p>

<p>"What do you say?" screamed the old
woman. "Talk louder! I cannot hear."</p>

<p>"The boy would like to own the dog," repeated
Guido, louder.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>

<p>"He would like to own the world!"
shrieked the old woman.</p>

<p>She started to drag Tony away, but he
escaped her and ran back to Guido.</p>

<p>"Let me stay with you!" he cried.</p>

<p>Then he lowered his voice so the old
woman could not hear what he said.</p>

<p>"The witch is cruel to me," he whined.
"She beats me every morning. Ah, I am not
happy."</p>

<p>"What is that? What is he saying?"
squealed the old woman, straining to hear.</p>

<p>But Tony kept his voice low.</p>

<p>"Let me live with you, sir!" he went on.
"I am a good boy and always do as I am
told!"</p>

<p>Tony's guardian took hold of the Marionette
Man's sleeve.</p>

<p>"Please, sir," she implored. "You must
not believe the tales Tony tells you. I am
sure they are lies. I have been good to him.
But each day he comes home with pockets empty.
Yet I know he has begged money
from the foreigners and has spent it on the
way home."</p>

<p>Guido gave Tony an amused look.</p>

<p>The old woman continued, "Always animals!"
she groaned. "This stupid child
would feed every cat, dog, goose, and donkey
while I starve!"</p>

<p>In a way, the old woman was right. Tony
did just this with his money. He spent it
on food for stray animals.</p>

<p>Or, sometimes he gave it to beggars who
sat on church steps. They were not so fortunate
as he. For he was beautiful to look
at and people always believed his sad tales.
He was a splendid actor.</p>

<p>He also knew that the old woman had
enough for herself. So why should he bring
home his pennies when men and beasts
starved on the streets?</p>

<p>But he did not put it this way to his guardian.
It was so much easier to turn his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
pockets inside out and say, with a roguish
smile, "Niente! (Nothing!)"</p>

<p>"How would you like me to take the lad
to live with me?" asked Guido, the Marionette
Man.</p>

<p>"Heaven protect you, sir!" cried the old
woman. "You do not know Tony!"</p>

<p>But here she was wrong, for Guido did
know Tony. He had often watched him on
the streets, begging. Such a clever child
would be able to help in the Marionette
show.</p>

<p>"Let me have him," said Guido, pleasantly.
"I am not afraid of little boys who
do not tell the truth. I will teach him as I
teach my little trained dog, eh?"</p>

<p>He laughed and looked into Tony's eyes.
Tony smiled at him and brushed away the
tears.</p>

<p>"Yes, I will come to live with you&mdash;and
with the little dog," he said. "Then I can
be with her always!"</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>

<p>"Yes, indeed," agreed Guido. He turned
to the old woman. "Are you willing?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Willing?" she cried. "Do you ask one
who suffers with toothache if he is willing to
part with the aching tooth? He is a rascal
and cares nothing for me. Indeed I am willing
to let you keep him. Yet&mdash;"</p>

<p>She hesitated. A softer expression came
over her face.</p>

<p>"You must promise to be good to him,"
she added. "His mother was my friend.
When she died she left him in my care. For
her sake, you must promise to treat Tony
well."</p>

<p>"I shall treat him as if he were my own,"
replied Guido, the Marionette Man.</p>

<h2>TONY AND THE BALILLA</h2>


<p>Several weeks passed. Tony was living
with Guido.</p>

<p>Each day the Marionette Man sent him to
the hotels to beg. Each evening he had to
help with the show. He set the tiny stage
and dusted the theatre.</p>

<p>If he did not do his work properly, Guido
would smile and say, "No supper tonight for
lazy people!"</p>

<p>This would not have mattered so much to
Tony if it had not been for Tina. But when
Tony did not eat, then neither did Tina.</p>

<p>The small scraps that Guido threw to the
dog were not enough to keep her alive. So
Tony always divided his meals with the
friend he loved.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>

  <table border="0" cellpadding="0" width="550">

  </table>

<p>Today, as usual, Tony, with his dog,
trudged along on his way to the hotels.
Once there, he stood outside of one and
waited. Two foreign ladies appeared at the
door. Immediately, tears gathered in
Tony's eyes. He ran up to them eagerly.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>

<p>"Ah, dear ladies, I am a poor, orphan
boy!" he moaned in Italian. Then he burst
into English: "No mudder! No fadder!"
he wailed.</p>

<p>The ladies looked at him pityingly. But
just then the hotel manager came out.</p>

<p>"Go along!" he commanded Tony. "You
are not allowed here. Run!"</p>

<p>He shooed Tony as if he had been stray
chickens. Tony scampered a few feet away.
When the hotel manager had gone, he again
began to make mournful signs to the strange
ladies.</p>

<p>But now they only laughed and shook
their heads, for they knew what a scamp he
was. So Tony laughed, too, and began to
sing good-naturedly. A Naples street boy
is like that.</p>

<p>The ladies drove off in a carriage and as
they passed they threw money to the rascal.
You see, nobody ever took the trouble to explain
things to Tony. Foreigners enjoyed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
his pretty acting, which only spoiled him.</p>

<p>For several hours Tony stayed around the
hotels, dodging hotel managers, and crying
his way into the hearts of strangers. Then,
he started toward the place he called home,
walking along the broad drive that faces
the Bay of Naples.</p>

<p>Naples is built like a giant theatre stage.
The shore is where the plays take place.
The shining Bay is the vast blue audience.</p>

<p>Out, facing the shore, is the famous Castle
of the Egg. Many stories are told about
this historical building.</p>

<p>It was once the home of Lucullus, a Roman
general who was very fond of eating.</p>

<p>One legend tells that the poet, Virgil, put
an enchanted egg between the walls of the
castle. So long as this egg remained in its
place, the city of Naples was supposed to
be safe.</p>

<p>But the real reason for the castle's strange
name is, no doubt, its egg-like shape.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>

<p>High up on a hill of Naples is a park of
rare beauty. From here one looks down
upon the island of Nisida. Like the Castle
of the Egg, this island was once the home
of great Roman generals. Today they are
both prisons.</p>

<p>But let us go back and find Tony. He now
turned into the crowded part of the city
where the noise and the smells begin. He
felt more at home there. He stopped and
bought a meal of fresh fish for Tina at
a small stand.</p>

<p>Then he stuffed himself full of macaroni
and candies. At last he had only a few
pennies left.</p>

<p>A boy in uniform had been watching
Tony. He was dressed in olive-green
breeches and black shirt. He wore a small
cap with a tassel on it.</p>

<p>He belonged to the Balilla, the Italian
Boy Scouts. The Government is directing
them in sports and work of all kinds. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
are growing up to be strong and loyal to
their country.</p>

<p>"Hello," said the boy to Tony.</p>

<p>"Good-bye," said Tony to the boy.</p>

<p>He began to saunter off.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>

<p>"Wait," said the boy. "I would like to
speak with you."</p>

<p>Now, every young Italian hopes to join
the Balilla. So, of course, Tony did, too.
But how could a little beggar, who had
hardly enough to eat, expect to belong to
such a grand company?</p>

<p>Tony did not even want to talk with this
modern son of Italy.</p>

<p>"I must go," he mumbled.</p>

<p>But the boy walked over to him and began
to speak earnestly.</p>

<p>"I just noticed that you were very hungry,"
he said. "Why was that?"</p>

<p>Tony's eyes gleamed angrily. "Because I
had eaten too much!" he snapped.</p>

<p>What right had this fellow to detain and
mock him because he was poor?</p>

<p>"I mean no harm," said the lad. "I only
want to help you. Do you know that you
may join the Balilla if you want to?"</p>

<p>"I?" inquired Tony.</p>

<p>"Yes, you, or any other boy who wishes
to join."</p>

<p>"But I have no money to pay for the uniform,"
said Tony.</p>

<p>"If you cannot pay, the State will give
you a uniform. Every boy in Italy should
belong to the Balilla."</p>

<p>As he said this he saluted. His arm shot
out stiffly, the palm of his hand exposed.
He drew himself up like a soldier.</p>

<p>"It is fine to march with a band," he went
on. "The State will help to educate you and
will send you to a seaside camp in summer."</p>

<p>"A poor boy like me?" Tony's eyes were
wide.</p>

<p>The other smiled. "Have you never heard
how the Balilla started?" he asked.</p>

<p>Then he told Tony about another poor
boy who had lived in Genoa years ago.
When the Austrians attacked his city, he
threw a stone and started an uprising. The
enemy was driven away.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>

<p>"That boy's name was 'Balilla,'" explained
Young Italy. "Before he threw the
stone, he went forward with the words,
'Shall I begin?'"</p>

<p>Tony's face shone with pleasure.</p>

<p>"Shall I begin? Shall I begin?" he muttered
to himself. Why not? It would be
glorious to march through the parks, waving
banners. He would study hard and
learn to be a soldier.</p>

<p>But then, Tony thought of the training
and discipline. He did not want to be
trained. He wanted to run wild and beg
money of foreigners.</p>

<p>And what of Tina? There would be no
place for a little dog in a military group of
boys.</p>

<p>Besides, Guido would never allow him to
join. Guido needed him.</p>

<p>But suppose he should run away from
Guido? Oh, then he felt sure that the Marionette
Man would starve Tina.</p>

<p>Tony always saw that the dog had enough
to eat. It was he who cared for her, dressed
her in her fancy costume and put her
through her little tricks between each act of
the puppet show.</p>

<p>She slept with Tony and did not have to
shiver outside any more. No, Tony could
not leave Tina!</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>

<p>"Will you come with me now?" asked
Young Italy. "Will you begin?"</p>

<p>Tony wiped the traces of macaroni from
his mouth. He looked straight at the boy
in uniform.</p>

<p>"I do not wish to join," he lied.</p>

<p>Then he ran off.</p>

<p>When he reached home Guido asked,
"Where is the money?"</p>

<p>Tony handed him two pennies.</p>

<p>Guido laughed. "The rest! Come, that
is not all!"</p>

<p>"It is all," said Tony.</p>

<p>He was not even thinking of what he was
saying. He was thinking only of the
Balilla and of the words, "Shall I begin?"</p>

<p>"If you do not give me all the money, you
and the dog will get no supper tonight!"
growled Guido. "Come, how much did you
make?"</p>

<p>"Shall I begin?" muttered Tony.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>

<p>Guido looked at him curiously. Had he
lost his wits?</p>

<p>"What are you mumbling about?" asked
the Marionette Man.</p>

<p>Tony shrugged his shoulders. "I should
lie if I told you!" he answered.</p>

<p>This was Tony's favorite expression. It
means "I don't know" in the language of
Naples. But in Tony's language it meant
exactly what it said!</p>

<h2>NIKI</h2>


<p>Italy! When you hear the word do you
think, as I do, of beautiful paintings and
music? Of organ grinders, macaroni, and
marionettes?</p>

<p>The finest little marionette actors (or
puppets) are made in Italy. Naples is
where they have been most popular.</p>

<p>Today there are few left. Motion pictures
have come to Naples as to every other city
in the world.</p>

<p>Guido's theatre was a small place with
crude, wooden benches. Tony helped Guido
work the puppets. Mrs. Guido played the
squeaky piano.</p>

<p>But the marionettes were really handsome.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
There were Kings and Queens in velvet
and purple. Knights in armour.</p>

<p>Tina performed between the acts. She
amused the audience while the scene was
being changed.</p>

<p>She would walk in on her hind legs, a ruff
around her neck. She would throw kisses
and nearly topple over backwards.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>

<p>She would turn 'round and 'round in a
sort of old-fashioned waltz. She might have
been a white, furry merry-go-round but for
the pink tongue that popped out so frequently.</p>

<p>When she finished her part, she always
ran straight to Tony. While he worked a
puppet with one hand, he untied her ruff
with the other. He knew she disliked the
stiff thing.</p>

<p>This afternoon the theatre was well
crowded. It was Saturday. As Tony lifted
Tina up on the stage, she turned and licked
his face. Then, out she waltzed and the
people began to clap.</p>

<p>When the clapping stopped, a child's
voice suddenly piped up, "Oh, it's Niki!
Papa, Papa, it's Niki!"</p>

<p>There was some laughter and whispering,
and everyone turned to look.</p>

<p>Tina made her final bow and her part was
over.</p>

<p>After the show, as Tony was putting away
the marionettes, a gentleman and a little
girl came to the back of the stage. They approached
Guido.</p>

<p>Tony heard angry talk between the two
men. However, it did not interest him until
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
he heard the girl say, "I know it is my dog!
I want my dog."</p>

<p>Tony listened now. He heard Guido laugh
nervously.</p>

<p>"That is absurd," said Guido. "The little
lady is mistaken. Tina is my dog. She belongs
to my show."</p>

<p>The gentleman raised his voice. "My
daughter is not mistaken," he said. "That
is her dog!"</p>

<p>"It was stolen from us," added the little
girl.</p>

<p>"We searched for it all over Naples but
could not find it," continued her father.</p>

<p>"I want Niki!" pleaded the child.</p>

<p>"You have stolen my daughter's pet," said
the gentleman. "I demand it back!"</p>

<p>Now Tony entered the scene. He held
Tina close. The little girl put out her arms
and cried, "Niki! Niki! I want my Niki!"</p>

<p>"Her name is Tina," said Tony. "She belongs
to Guido&mdash;and me."</p>

<p>"That is not true," said the gentleman.
"This Guido, your father, has stolen our dog.
If he does not give it back at once, I shall
call the police!"</p>

<p>Guido looked afraid and Tony noticed it.
He must think of a way to save Tina!
With a broad grin the young beggar stepped
up to the little girl.</p>

<p>"It is true that Guido stole your dog,
Niki," he said. "But this is not Niki. You
see, that was a long time ago and Niki died.
Ah, poor thing!"</p>

<p>He wiped away a false tear and stroked
Tina's head fondly.</p>

<p>"This is our own Tina," he added.</p>

<p>"Oh, Papa!" wailed the poor little girl.
"Niki is dead!"</p>

<p>But the father was not so easily deceived.
"Give me the dog," he said. "I wish to see
it more closely."</p>

<p>Tony started to draw back with Tina, but
the man snatched her out of his arms.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>

<p>"What you have told me is a lie," he declared.
"This is indeed my daughter's dog.
I recognize her by the peculiar marking under
her chin."</p>

<p>He glared angrily at Tony.</p>

<p>"You are a lying little scamp as your
father is a thief!" he said.</p>

<p>Then, he took his daughter's hand and
the two, with Tina, departed.</p>

<p>Tony stood like a figure of wax. He
hardly heard Guido raging beside him.</p>

<p>"Now what shall I do?" stormed the Marionette
Man. "I must have another dog.
You shall steal one for me, Tony."</p>

<p>As he said this, he turned to face Tony,
but the boy had vanished.</p>

<p>Tony had run out of the theatre after Tina
and her owners. Now he stood on the street,
watching them as they stepped into an automobile.</p>

<p>As the car started, Tony sprang onto the
back of it. He held fast.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>

<p>This was his first automobile ride! It was
not a pleasant one. It seemed to him, holding
on with all his might, that it would never
end. On, on, they sped. Where to, he wondered?</p>

<p>Tony had never been outside of Naples.
But often he had read or listened to tales of
other parts of his country. He knew that
Italy was a fine land.</p>

<p>The school textbooks told him that "Italy
is blessed by God. It is strong, powerful,
and feared."</p>

<p>He loved to learn all he could about it. He
was proud of being an Italian.</p>

<p>Now the automobile had come upon the
open road. Tony could see the Bay. He
could also see the great volcano, Vesuvius,
which towers over Naples.</p>

<p>It is a fire-mountain and smoke is always
coming out of its top.</p>

<p>In olden days people believed that a lame
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
blacksmith lived under the ground. He kept
a furnace burning to heat his irons. His
name was Vulcan and from it comes the
word, "volcano."</p>

<p>Tony had heard that this volcano, or fire-mountain,
had often caused much damage.
Villages had been destroyed when the giant
spat fire and ashes to earth. Houses rocked
and fell. Towns were buried.</p>

<p>But Tony was not thinking of this now.
He was wishing with all his heart that the
car would stop. Until it did, however, he
must remain at his post. Tina was in that
car! And where Tina went there went
Tony!</p>

<p>The thoughts went racing through his
head as the car raced on. The father of that
little girl had called Guido a thief! Tony
shuddered. He remembered the time when
the old woman had called him a thief. How
terrible it had made him feel!</p>

<p>Thieves were bad men. Guido was a bad
man. And they thought he was Tony's
father! What an insult!</p>

<p>The car was slowing up. It stopped before
a white house with trees and a garden
surrounding it. The gentleman and his
daughter, with Tina in her arms, got out.</p>

<p>They went inside the house. Tony saw
the front door close behind them. He slid
down from the back of the automobile. He
ran to the house and crouched under a window.
He could look right into a room.</p>

<p>He saw a sweet-faced woman greet the
little girl and her father. She kissed them
both. Then she noticed Tina in the child's
arms.</p>

<p>"Why, Anna!" she exclaimed. "It is your
little dog that was lost!"</p>

<p>The girl named Anna laughed happily.
She showed pearly teeth. Her whole face
lit up with joy.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mama, it is Niki," she said. "At
last we have found her! I am so happy!"</p>

<p>The father told how they had discovered
Niki in the Marionette theatre.</p>

<p>"It was the Marionette Man who stole
Niki away from us," he said. "She was performing
on the stage."</p>

<p>"And, oh, Mama!" exclaimed Anna, "his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
little boy said that Niki died, and it wasn't
true at all! That boy was a story-teller,
wasn't he, papa?"</p>

<p>"He was a young rascal," replied her
father. "Still, he had such an intelligent
face. What a pity!"</p>

<p>Tony, under the window, drew closer to
listen.</p>

<p>"The lad is already a clever liar and no
doubt a beggar as well," Anna's father continued.
"One day he will become a thief
like Guido!"</p>

<p>Tony crouched lower and winced. "A
thief like Guido!" The words had a dreadful
sound.</p>

<p>"I should like to train that boy," remarked
Anna's father. "I would discipline him!"</p>

<p>The gentleman looked very fierce as he
said this. He frightened Tony, who hated
discipline!</p>

<p>But if Tony had known exactly what he
meant, he would not have been frightened.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
Anna's father had always wanted a son of
his own. He would have been very proud
of a son.</p>

<p>He would have taught him to be a loyal
Italian. For Anna's father was a real patriot.</p>

<p>Robert Browning, the poet, has said,
"Open my heart and you will see inside of it&mdash;Italy."
If Anna's father had been a poet,
he might have said something like this.</p>

<p>"Dinner is ready," announced Anna's
mother.</p>

<p>Tony watched as the family left the room.
He knew that they had gone into the dining
room. He waited patiently beneath the window
until they returned.</p>

<p>When they came back, Anna's father
eased himself into an armchair.</p>

<p>"Come, little Anna," he said. "I am going
to read to you."</p>

<p>Anna crawled on to his lap with Tina
clasped lovingly in her arms. Tina had a
puffed, happy look, as if she, too, had dined
well!</p>

<p>Tony smiled to himself. He was going to
hear Anna's father read stories. No one
had ever read to Tony. He loved reading.</p>

<p>The night was warm. The moon shone.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
The window was open. Tony listened.</p>

<p>Would you like to listen, too?</p>

<p>Very well.</p>

<p>Wouldn't Anna's father be surprised if
he knew about his big audience? Under the
window is a poor Italian boy&mdash;Tony. Out
in the great United States are other boys
and girls&mdash;you who are reading this tale!</p>

<p>So be very quiet and don't make a noise
for fear of disturbing Anna's father while
he reads.</p>

<p>"Tonight," began Anna's father, "we are
going to read about one of our Italian cities.
Many fine stories have come out of it.</p>

<p>"Rome is called 'The Eternal City' because
there is a saying that it will live forever. It
is built upon seven hills.</p>

<p>"A long time ago there lived a great artist
named Michelangelo. He built the dome of
St. Peter's Cathedral in Rome. This is the
largest church in the world. Thirty services
may be conducted in it at the same time.</p>

<p>"The bones of St. Peter are believed to
have been buried beneath the Cathedral.</p>

<p>"But the oldest church of all is the Pantheon,

God. It has no windows but only a hole in

<p>"There is a curious park in Rome," went
on the father. "One which you, little Anna,
would like."</p>

<p>Anna looked up. "Why, Papa?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Because it is filled with cats," answered
her father. "Tabbies and Tommies, black
and white, grey and yellow. They wander
about and sprawl in the shade of fine old
trees. They have plenty to eat and nothing
to fear. It is a kitty paradise!"</p>

<p>"I want to go to that park some day," said
Anna.</p>

<p>"There is a magic fountain in Rome," read
her father. "It is said that he who drinks
from the Fontana Trevi will some day be
drawn back to The Eternal City.</p>

Queen of Roads. It was a great highway

wished his people to marry women of the
neighboring cities. But the neighbors refused
to marry the Romans.</p>

Sabines to a great feast. During the entertainment
the Romans seized the young
Sabine women and carried them off. Later,

<p>But Anna's father would so have liked a
son. One who would be more interested in
the Balilla than in "little mama animals."</p>

<p>Yet he loved his daughter very dearly.
He now kissed her dark curls as he said, "It
is time for bed, mia cara (my dear). Tomorrow
night more stories."</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>

<p>Anna sat up in his arms. Tina awoke and
blinked.</p>

<p>"Before I go to bed, I must put Niki to
bed, too," said Anna.</p>

<p>Her father answered, "Then we must
make a house for her."</p>

<p>Tony saw him open a chest of drawers and
take out some curious things.</p>

<p>"Now," he said to his daughter, "Come
into the back garden, and we shall see what
kind of house-builder I am!"</p>

<p>Tony watched them leave the room and
saw a light switch on in the hallway. Then
the back door opened. Father, daughter,
and dog went into the garden.</p>

<p>They found an old crate with the top missing.
They covered it with what appeared to
be a fancy tablecover. They tied the little
dog securely to the side.</p>

<p>"There!" said Anna's father. "It looks
like a tent on the desert. Niki will feel like
an Arabian Princess!"</p>

<p>Anna stooped down and caressed her pet.</p>

<p>"Felicissima notte, Niki," said Anna. This
meant "Happiest night, Niki," and it is what
the Italians say for "Good-night."</p>

<p>When Anna and her father had left, Tony
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
ran over to the kennel-tent. Tina nearly
wagged herself to pieces with joy. Tony
sank down beside her. He buried his head
in her soft hair.</p>

<p>"Ah, Tina mia (my Tina)!" he said. "I
thought they had taken you from me forever!
But I have found you again."</p>

<p>He started to untie the dog. He would
run away with her. Far away! Never back
to Guido! Guido was a thief. A man who
stole little dogs!</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, Tony remembered that
he, too, was about to steal a little dog! He,
too, would be a thief if he did that. Tina
did not belong to him. She belonged to little
Anna.</p>

<p>But how could he bear to leave Tina? A
tear ran down his cheek. Tina licked it
sadly. She seemed to know what he was
thinking about.</p>

<p>How he longed to snuggle up close to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
little dog and go fast asleep. Just as he had
done every night since he went to live with
Guido.</p>

<p>Why did Anna have to love Tina, too?</p>

<p>He would stay. Just tonight. He would
crawl into Tina's tent with her. In the
morning he could decide what to do. He
was so sleepy now.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>

<p>He yawned, brushed his tears away, and
wriggled into the tent. He curled up in
there, with Tina in his arms.</p>

<p>But just as sleep came creeping over him,
a sound was heard in the garden. Tony
gave a start and opened his eyes. Tina gave
a low growl.</p>

<p>Tony looked out and saw a white figure approaching
the tent. It was Anna. She was
coming back to see her new-found Niki once
more.</p>

<p>She would find Tony there. She would tell
her father! What should he do? His heart
began to thump. He lay quite still.</p>

<p>"Niki!" whispered Anna, softly.</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>"Niki!" repeated Anna. "I have come to
kiss you good-night. Here, Niki!"</p>

<p>She bent down in front of the tent and
looked in. It was dark inside. Tony lay
flat on the floor and kept very quiet.</p>

<p>Anna put her hand inside the tent and felt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
for her pet. Tina tried to hide from the
hand, but it found her and lifted her out
tenderly.</p>

<p>Anna caressed the dog and spoke gently
to her.</p>

<p>"Now, Niki," she said. "You shall go back
to bed and mama will cover you up."</p>

<p>She had brought with her a doll's blanket.
She put Tina back into the tent and tried to
make her lie down flat. She could do this so
easily with her dolls.</p>

<p>But, somehow, Tina was different. Tina
did not want to lie down flat! The real
reason for this was because Anna was
spreading Tina on Tony's face!</p>

<p>The poor dog struggled and kicked. The
poor boy tried his best to lie still and make
no noise. But would you enjoy a dog
plastered upon your face?</p>

<p>So Tony wriggled. He snorted. He
sneezed.</p>

<p>Anna saw. She heard. She started and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
gave a little cry. Tony's head came out of
the tent like a turtle's head coming out of
its shell.</p>

<p>Anna drew back. "Who are you?" she
gasped.</p>

<p>"I'm Tony," he replied. "Please let me
stay here with Tina tonight. Tomorrow I'll
go away."</p>

<p>Then Anna recognized him. "Oh," she
exclaimed. "You are that naughty Marionette
boy who told a lie! I am going to call
my father!"</p>

<p>She turned toward the house but Tony
quickly caught her arm.</p>

<p>"No, no!" he pleaded. "I mean no harm.
I love the little dog. Let me stay. Only one
night. Do not tell your father&mdash;please!"</p>

<p>In the moonlight Anna could see that
tears filled his eyes. She began to feel sorry
for him.</p>

<p>"Are you a very poor little boy?" she
asked, innocently.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, very, very poor!" he moaned.
"I have no home. No mother. No father.
Everyone is cruel to me. The little dog was
my only friend, and now you have taken
her from me."</p>

<p>Tony was born with the Italian gift for
beautiful acting. He now acted his best for
Anna. While some of his pitiful tale was
true, some was sprinkled with the fairy dust
of fancy.</p>

<p>"Every morning Guido beats me," he made
up. "He uses a big stick. And when he
stops beating me, he makes me sing to him.
Then, all day long he feeds me bird-seed
mixed with soap and nothing else!"</p>

<p>Anna's gentle eyes grew wider and wider,
her tender heart softer and softer.</p>

<p>Tony warmed to his work. His success encouraged
him. He began to gesture with
his arms. He began to invent wild tales.</p>

<p>"Often I fall upon the streets because I
am so hungry," he continued. "When it
rains, Guido makes me lie outside the whole
night through.</p>

<p>"One morning, when I awoke, I found myself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
in a pool of water. I had to swim all the
way home!"</p>

<p>The little girl's lip began to tremble. This
gave Tony added courage. He drew a deep
breath. His style improved.</p>

<p>"And once I was thrown over a cliff.
Lions came prowling...."</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>

<p>He stopped, for little Anna had begun
to cry.</p>

<p>"Oh, you poor boy!" she sobbed. "I am
so sorry for you! I shall tell my father and
mother. They will take care of you."</p>

<p>"No, you must not do that," said Tony,
quickly. "If your father knows I am here,
he will discipline me!"</p>

<p>"But my father is good," said Anna.</p>

<p>"That is why he will discipline me," replied
Tony. "Because I am bad."</p>

<p>Now, to a very little girl like Anna, that
seemed sensible enough. She believed what
Tony told her. She even believed that her
father might not be kind to the beggar boy.
Often her father was very severe.</p>

<p>So she promised that she would not tell.</p>

<p>"You may stay here every night, poor
little boy," she said. "I will bring food and
leave it for you in a dish. I will put a soft
cushion inside the tent. I will never tell my
father that you are here."</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>

<p>"Ah, grazie signorina (thank you, Miss),"
said Tony, charmingly. He smiled and
showed his white teeth. "How kind you
are! And will you also put some candy on
the dish?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I will, poor little boy," she answered.
"What kind do you like?"</p>

<p>Tony thought a moment. Then he replied,
"Torrone." (This is the finest and
most expensive Italian candy.)</p>

<p>Anna promised to leave some torrone.
Tony bent low and kissed her hand as he
had seen the marionettes do in romantic
plays.</p>

<p>"Felicissima notte, bella signorina!
(Good-night, beautiful Miss!)" he murmured.</p>

<p>Again his play acting and falsehoods had
brought him success! He did not even know
that he had done anything wrong. Poor
neglected little Tony!</p>

<h2>CITIES, ANIMALS, AND DISCIPLINE</h2>


<p>Next day Tony left Anna's garden early
in the morning. He ambled along the
smooth motor road, singing and begging
whenever he found someone to beg from.</p>

<p>On each side of the road were black posts
with white caps on them, glistening in the
sun, polished to shine. Snow-white oxen
passed, driven by farmers.</p>

<p>In vineyards grapevines climbed and
twisted about old trees. In nearly every
archway a baby, a goat, or a donkey stood
and stared at Tony as he passed.</p>

<p>Women and children with large baskets
or bundles on their heads trudged by. Tiny
donkeys carried mountainous loads on their
backs.</p>

<p>Occasionally, there would be an automobile.
Tony liked the little cars named
"Balilla," after the Boys' Group. They are
the smallest Italian cars made.</p>

<p>Tony bought chestnuts and munched
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
them. Chestnuts often take the place of
bread among the poor people.</p>

<p>Toward the end of day Tony began to miss
Tina. He had seldom been separated from
her for such a long time. So he returned to
Anna's house.</p>

<p>He hoped that Anna had not forgotten to
leave his dinner. He also hoped that her
father would not forget to tell more stories
tonight. This was a pleasant life.</p>

<p>But, of course, Tony was too wise to think
that he could go on living like this forever.
Guido might find him. Or Anna's father
might discover him.</p>

<p>Yet if he ran off with Tina he would be a
"thief like Guido!" No, that would never,
never do!</p>

<p>Oh, how difficult it all was!</p>

<p>But upon arriving at Tina's tent he forgot
his troubles, for he found there a neatly covered
dish. It contained macaroni, meat, and
salad. An ideal meal for an Italian boy!</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>

<p>Also, Anna had really left some torrone
on the plate. Tony sighed with pleasure and
began to eat. Good little Anna!</p>

<p>All day the little girl had been thinking
of the beggar boy. However, she had kept
her adventure a secret.</p>

<p>But, oh, Tony, beware! Anna is very
young, and it is difficult for small children
to keep secrets. Especially, when secrets
are as interesting as you are!</p>

<p>This evening the weather was cooler. The
moon did not shine. When Tony finished
his dinner, he slipped under the window as
he had done before. He hoped Anna's
father would tell more stories of Italy.</p>

<p>Presently, he saw the family enter the
room. They had dined. The mother took
up her sewing. The father settled himself
in his chair with a book.</p>

<p>Anna, with her dog, nestled down in his
lap. Tony knew that now more stories were
coming. He leaned against the side of the house.</p>

<p>"Yes, and about animals, too," said Anna.</p>

<p>Her father laughed. "Perhaps we shall
meet some as we wander," he said. "Listen,
now, while I tell you of Florence.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>

<p>"It is a city of ancient palaces! In the
days of the civil war, homes of the rich were
built like fortresses. This was to protect
them from the enemy. Most of these prison-like
palaces still stand.</p>

<p>"Florence is a city of art! The famous
Campanile, or bell tower, reminds us of its
artist-architect, Giotto. Here is a story told
about the painter when he was a peasant lad
tending his father's sheep.</p>

<p>"One day a great artist named Cimabue
paid a visit to the countryside. He was impressed
by a sketch which the young shepherd
had made.</p>

<p>"He gained the consent of Giotto's father
to take his son to Florence. There he promised
to teach the boy how to paint.</p>

<p>"So Giotto became Cimabue's apprentice,
or helper. He worked hard and learned a
great deal. But, like all boys, he was fun-loving.
One day he played a joke upon his
master.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>

<p>"Cimabue had gone out, leaving in the
studio an unfinished portrait of a gentleman.
When he returned, there was a fly
sitting upon the nose of his painting.</p>

<p>"He tried to brush off the fly but it would
not move. He looked more closely and discovered
what had happened. His mischievous
young apprentice, Giotto, had painted
that fly!</p>

<p>"The master was not angry. He enjoyed
the joke and recognized the lad's skill.</p>

<p>"Giotto became known as the father of
one of the first schools of painting.</p>

<p>"Florence is also a city of great men!</p>

<p>"One day, long ago, a nine-year-old boy
named Dante went to the feast of flowers,
which is celebrated every year. Here,
among the beautiful blossoms, he beheld
one more beautiful and sweet than all the
rest.</p>

<p>"But this one was not a flower. She was
a little maiden and her name was Beatrice.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
All day long Dante watched her as she
played about, and never, throughout his
whole life, did he forget her.</p>

<p>"Though they seldom met, the little girl
named Beatrice was forever with Dante in
his dreams. To her he wrote most of his
marvelous poetry. For Dante became
Italy's greatest poet!</p>

<p>"Florence, city of wonders!</p>

<p>"A legend tells that when Christ went to
heaven he carried with him a cricket. So,
each year, before Ascension Day, everybody
buys a cricket.</p>

<p>"They guard their crickets most carefully.
For, if one should die, misfortune befalls its
owner.</p>

<p>"On Ascension Day a crowd gathers in the
park. Here there is much gaiety, with balloons,
music, and fireworks.</p>

<p>"At a certain time each person opens
the door of his cricket's cage and frees it.</p>

cricket leaps into the air, good fortune will
follow the owner. But if he creeps slowly
away, his poor owner will suffer bad luck.</p>

<p>"Of course, today few people really believe
this. But they still keep up the quaint old
custom.</p>

<p>"Florence is a grey cluster of narrow
streets and dignified squares. It seems to
bulge with art treasures, and it has a charm
of its own.</p>

<p>"Near Florence, in Pisa, is the curious
Leaning Tower. It is one of the Seven Wonders
of the World. It seems to be toppling
over. Yet it has stood this way for hundreds
of years. Maybe it is tired."</p>

<p>Anna's father stopped reading.</p>

<p>"Is my little girl tired, too?" he asked.
"Shall I put down the book?"</p>

<p>"No, no, Papa!" said Anna.</p>

<p>Tony, under the window wanted to answer,
"No, no!" too. But, then, his opinion
had not been asked.</p>

<p>"The next story is about Venice," continued
the father.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>

<p>"Once upon a time there lived in Italy a
people known as the Veneti. They were not
fish, yet they built a city in the water.</p>

<p>"Savage tribes had driven them from
their land. They had no home. So they
settled upon some small islands at the head
of the Adriatic Sea. They called their
island-city Venice.</p>

<p>"Fish were plentiful. They salted them
and traded them for treasures of all kinds.
People began to come from everywhere to
buy these treasures. Venice became the
most important market in Europe.</p>

<p>"St. Mark is the patron saint of Venice.
To him the Veneti, or Venetians, have built
a wonderful cathedral. In front stands the
statue of a lion, the favorite animal of St.
Mark.</p>

<p>"Four huge horses adorn the door.
Though they are made of bronze, they have
travelled widely. They have been moved to
different places at many times.</p>

<p>"St. Mark's Square is the largest piece of
ground in Venice. The rest is water.
Streets are canals. Boatmen guide long,
black boats called gondolas through these
canals. They sing and cry out strange signals
to other boatmen.</p>

<p>"In years gone by Venice, like Rome, was
a world of its own. A Doge, or Duke, ruled
over the city.</p>

that is why the bridge is known as 'The

they blow melted glass into vases and bowls.
Venetian glass is famous.</p>

<p>"There are hundreds of pigeons flying

Venice, you must surely allow a pigeon to
sit upon your head. If you do not do this,
your visit will not be complete and I am sure
the pigeon will be disappointed!</p>

<p>The father looked up from his book. Anna
laughed.</p>

<p>Anna looked puzzled.</p>

<p>"Don't you remember the crickets of
Florence?" asked her father. "And that fly
which Giotto painted on the nose of Cimabue's
painting!"</p>

<p>"Oh, that was a nice chapter," said the
little girl. "Now some more."</p>

<p>Her father began to read again:</p>

<p>"The greatest playwright in the world
was Shakespeare. He was an Englishman.
He wrote a play called 'Romeo and Juliet.'"</p>

<p>"Was it about animals?" asked Anna.</p>

<p>"No," smiled her father. "It was about
two lovers. It is a very famous story and
the scene is laid in Verona, an Italian city.</p>

<p>"In Verona there is a beautiful little grave
where they say Romeo and Juliet are buried.
The statue of Shakespeare stands over it."</p>

<p>"But how can they be buried if they were
only book people?" asked Anna.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>

<p>"Maybe they buried the book which Mr.

<p>Just then there came a queer, muffled
noise under the window. Tony had sneezed!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
Anna's father, turning the pages of the
book, did not seem to hear it. But Anna,
who had been thinking of Tony, did.</p>

<p>She wanted so much to tell her father
about the poor boy. She really did not think
that her father would be unkind to him.
Yet she had promised to say nothing, and
she must keep her word.</p>

<p>"Papa," she suddenly asked. "If you had
a little boy who told stories and did not
obey, what would you do to him?"</p>

<p>Her father hesitated a moment. Then he
answered, "I would try to teach him the
beauty of truth and I would discipline him."</p>

<p>His voice had a very severe ring. He continued:</p>

<p>"There are too many lazy little beggars
in the streets of Naples, like that lying
young son of the Marionette Man. They
have never been properly trained, and they
are a disgrace to a beautiful city. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
should be taught. They should be made to
obey!"</p>

<p>Upon the word "obey," his hand came
down with a bang on the arm of the chair.
It made Tony jump.</p>

<h2>STATUES, MUSIC, AND CHEESE</h2>


<p>Tony, under the window, squirmed unhappily.
He was everything that Anna's
father had called him. Lazy! He begged!
He did not always tell the truth. He was a
disgrace to beautiful Naples!</p>

<p>But he did not want to be disciplined. He
did not want to obey. He was afraid of
Anna's father with his ideas of discipline.</p>

<p>He shivered and huddled up closer to the
house. It was growing colder, and his nose
felt stuffy. How warm and cosy it looked
inside!</p>

<p>Anna's father found the page he had been
looking for.</p>

<p>"Now," said he, "we are going to hear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>

sailors, music, and cheese!"</p>

<p>Tony forgot the cold. He even forgot
Anna's father except for his deep voice.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>

<p>"The city of Genoa," read the deep voice,
"is Italy's chief seaport. Its streets are
lined with palaces. It seems that everything
in Genoa takes place in a palace. Even
schools are sometimes found in palaces!</p>

<p>"The city is surrounded by forts and
strong walls.</p>

<p>"The Palazzo San Giorgio is the oldest
bank in Europe. Here there is a curious collection
of statues.</p>

<p>"They are the statues of men who have
given money for public good. If you see a
seated statue, you will know that this man
gave a large gift.</p>

<p>"If a statue is standing, it means that the
gift was not so large. No doubt, they wish
to make the generous ones more comfortable.</p>

<p>"Genoa might be called 'America's Cradle.'
Do you know why?"</p>

<p>Anna did not know. But Anna was an
Italian girl. You, who are Americans,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
surely know that Genoa was the birthplace
of Christopher Columbus.</p>

<p>"Christopher Columbus used to play about
the water front when he was a little boy,"
read Anna's father. "When he grew up, he
sailed off one day and discovered a new
country&mdash;America!</p>

<p>"Genoa possesses one of the largest theatres
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
and one of the finest cemeteries in the
world!"</p>

<p>"I would rather go to the theatre!" declared
Anna.</p>

<p>Tony agreed with her.</p>

<p>So did Tina. For, at that moment, she
gave a rumbling grunt, yawned, and went
back to sleep.</p>

<p>Anna's father read on:</p>

<p>"In 1813, in the Province of Parma, a baby
by the name of Giuseppe Verdi was born.
One year after this, a terrible battle took
place in the village.</p>

<p>"Women and children rushed to the
church for protection. But the enemy broke
into the church.</p>

<p>"Among these poor villagers was the
mother of Giuseppe Verdi. With her baby
in her arms, she fled up into the belfry tower.
Here she hid until all danger from the battle
was past.</p>

<p>"Think what the world would have lost if
she had not done this! For that baby became
the father of Italian opera!</p>

<p>"His haunting melodies are sung everywhere.
You have heard them though you
may not know it.</p>

<p>"When Verdi was a little boy, he used to
assist the priest in church. One day the
notes of the organ carried him far away to
dreamland. He did not hear the priest ask
for some water.</p>

<p>"No water came. The priest waited. Then
he repeated, 'Water!' Still no sign from
Giuseppe.</p>

<p>"'Water!' The priest was growing angry.
He touched his dreaming assistant with the
toe of his shoe. Down the steps, head first,
fell young Verdi!</p>

<p>"The older he grew the more Verdi loved
his native land. At this time the people of
Italy were ruled by the Austrians. They
were unhappy and wanted their own king,
Victor Emmanuel.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>

<p>"Verdi's music always stirred within them
a deep love of their country.</p>

<p>"It was found that the name 'Verdi' could
be spelled by using the first letters of the
words, '<i>V</i>ictor <i>E</i>mmanuel, <i>R</i>é <i>d</i>'<i>I</i>talia'
(which means, in English, "Victor Emmanuel,
King of Italy").</p>

<p>"The Italians would cry 'Verdi! Verdi!'
The Austrians thought, of course, that these
were only cheers for the popular composer.
But they were really crying, 'Victor Emmanuel,
King of Italy!' Had the Austrians
known this, they would have been very
angry."</p>

<p>Anna's father looked up from the book
once more.</p>

<p>"Did you ever hear the saying, 'From the
sublime to the ridiculous?'" he asked.</p>

<p>"No, Papa," said Anna. "What does it
mean?"</p>

<p>"It might mean," he replied, "that we are
now going from beautiful music to cheese!"</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>

<p>Tony wondered whether the gentleman
had suddenly lost his wits.</p>

<p>"Of course, cheese is not at all ridiculous
if you like it," he went on. "And most Italians
do like it.</p>

<p>"Macaroni without cheese is like Mexican
tamales without chile. It is like fish without
chips in England, or sausage without sauerkraut
in Germany!</p>

<p>"Parma is not only the home of a famous
composer; it is also the home of a famous
cheese! When I was there, I saw a poster
of three, huge-nosed gentlemen sniffing at
a piece of Parmesan cheese. Their eyes
bulged with delight.</p>

<p>"Just as Verdi once was carried away by
music, so these gentlemen were carried away
by the odor of cheese!"</p>

<p>Tony saw Tina's black nose wriggling in
her sleep. He almost laughed aloud. Did
the little dog understand what was being
said?</p>

<h2>DANGER!</h2>


<p>Tony was cold. He wanted Tina. He
hoped that soon Anna would come out to put
the dog to bed. But as soon as that happened,
the stories would have to stop.</p>

<p>Tony did not want them to stop. If only
he had Tina and a warm blanket! Then he
would stay beneath the window and listen
as long as the stories continued. What fun!</p>

<p>He sneezed again.</p>

<p>Anna sat up in her father's arms.</p>

<p>"I must go now and put Niki to bed," she
said. "Then I will come back."</p>

<p>Tony saw her climb down from her
father's knee. Tina woke up and blinked.
Anna left the room, and Tony knew that she
was coming out to the garden.</p>

Anna arrived.</p>

<p>"Hello, poor little boy," she said. "I heard
you under the window. Are you cold? Are
you sad?"</p>

<p>"Ah, Signorina," wailed Tony. "I am
nearly dead!"</p>

<p>He made a most horrible face.</p>

<p>"Today I have walked miles and miles, but
nobody would help me or give me anything
to eat. They only kicked me off the road and&mdash;will
you bring me a blanket?" he asked
suddenly.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said. She put Tina into his
arms. "Hold Niki and I will go into the
house for one."</p>

<p>She ran back. Tony, with the dog in his
arms, crouched once more under the window.
Through it he saw Anna come into the
room. Her father called her to him.</p>

<p>"Come," he said. "One more chapter and
then to bed."</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>

<p>Anna's face fell. What should she do?
She had promised to bring Tony a blanket.
Yet she could not say so. She must stay here
until her father finished reading.</p>

<p>"Now," he began, "we shall visit Italy's
largest city, Milan. The pride of Milan is
her beautiful cathedral. It is built of white
marble brought from the quarries by canal.
The canal was built especially for that purpose.</p>

<p>"With its two thousand slender spires, this
cathedral is like fairy lace. Stories are told
upon the many beautiful windows of stained
glass.</p>

<p>"In the long ago, Milan was the fashion
center of the world. Just as, today, every
lady wants a Paris gown, so, at that time,
they wanted Milan hats. They spoke of them
as 'Milaners.' Can you see how the word
'milliner' was born?</p>

<p>"From the hat to the shoe is a long way.
The whole of Italy is shaped like a boot.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
Milan is far up on the leg. Down at the tip
of the toe is the island of Sicily.</p>

<p>"Sicily, originally settled by the Greeks,
has often been called the 'football of Italy.'
And it has truly been kicked about, for many
different nations have ruled it.</p>

<p>"It is a beautiful island. Yet for many
years its people have been gradually leaving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
it. Many thousands went to America.</p>

<p>"At one time the United States bought
quantities of lemons from Sicily. Now the
Americans are growing their own.</p>

<p>"There is a volcano on the island called
Mt. Etna. Great sulphur mines were made
by this volcano, and for years Sicily supplied
the world with sulphur. But now the United
States also supplies sulphur.</p>

<p>"Another volcano is that of Stromboli. It
is an island off the coast of Sicily. For two
thousand years this fire island has been like
a glowing torch in the water. It is therefore
called the Lighthouse of the Mediterranean
Sea.</p>

<p>"And while we are speaking of volcanoes,
here is the terrible story of Pompeii. I have
told you many legends, but this tale is true.</p>

<p>"Hundreds of years ago a beautiful little
city called Pompeii nestled at the foot of Mt.
Vesuvius.</p>

<p>"Here men, women, and children lived
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
happy, carefree lives. Their houses were
small jewels. They feasted and lived in
luxury. Pompeii was a pleasure city.</p>

<p>"Then, one day, a frightful thing happened.
The volcano, Vesuvius, grew very
angry. Black smoke gushed from the hole
in her great head. Ashes and hot stones
came tumbling down upon Pompeii. The
earth rocked. Thunder roared. Darkness
fell upon the town. People fled, groping
their way through the streets.</p>

<p>"Next day Pompeii, the jewel city, lay
buried beneath the earth."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Tony felt a chill run up his back. He
glanced at the fire-mountain behind the
house. Then he looked into the window
again. Anna lay very still in her father's
arms.</p>

<p>Anna had heard that story many times.
Besides, Anna was very young. She was
now asleep!</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>

<p>"Wake up, little sleepy one," said her
father. He smoothed her hair gently.</p>

<p>Anna stirred and rubbed her eyes. She
had been dreaming about Tony. Oh, Tony,
your secret is in danger!</p>

<p>All at once she sat up straight and looked
about in a startled way.</p>

<p>She cried, "I must go out to Tony, Papa!
I promised to bring him a blanket!"</p>

<h2>THE BURIED CITY</h2>


<p>Tony clutched Tina and started. Anna's
father looked at his daughter in a puzzled
way.</p>

<p>"Who is Tony and what do you mean?" he
asked.</p>

<p>Then poor little Anna's heart sank. She
had given away her friend's secret!</p>

<p>Tony balanced himself on his toes, squatting,
ready to run. He saw Anna burst into
tears, heard her pour out her whole story.</p>

<p>"He is such a poor little boy, Papa!" she
wept. "He is so hungry and cold! But I
promised I would not tell and now ...
oh...."</p>

<p>She sobbed pitifully. Her father held her
close.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>

<p>"There, my darling, don't cry," he said.
"Tony is a bad boy. Come, let us go out there
to him and...."</p>

<p>Tony did not wait to hear more. With
Tina clasped tightly he ran. He ran as fast
as his legs would carry him, out, on to the
main road.</p>

<p>He saw Vesuvius towering above, a terrible
giantess puffing on a poisonous pipe!
Would she ever again break out in anger?</p>

<p>The wind blew. It had started to rain.
The night was so black.</p>

<p>His legs ached. But he must run, run far
away from Anna's father. He could never,
never go back again. Now he was really a
thief. He was running away with Tina!</p>

<p>The little dog began to shiver in his arms.
He stopped for a moment, took off his coat,
and wrapped it around the animal.</p>

<p>The rain came down harder and harder.
Finally, Tony found a haystack, and the boy
and dog cuddled down for the night.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>


<p>Early morning brought a blue sky. The
rain was gone. The Bay shone and the
smoke from Vesuvius sailed straight up in
a thin grey line.</p>

<p>But Tony awoke in a fever. Tina stood beside
him, her tail beating a pleasant tune on
the ground. Her sweet, white face smiled
down at him.</p>

<p>Why did he not jump up and play with her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
as he always did in the morning? Why did
her little god lie so still?</p>

<p>Tony's dark eyes sparkled unnaturally.
There were red patches on either cheek.</p>

<p>For a moment he could not remember
where he was. Then it all came back to him.
Anna! Anna's father!</p>

<p>He had stolen Tina! He was a thief!</p>

<p>He sat up suddenly. Perhaps they were
already looking for him.</p>

<p>He shivered and put on his coat. It was
damp. Tina barked joyfully. They were
going for a walk!</p>

<p>It was a long walk! Miles and miles.
Hours and hours. Tony's head throbbed.
His feet ached. Tina's tongue swept the
ground.</p>

<p>At last they reached the buried city of
Pompeii. Its ruins are now the most famous
in the world. Tourists visit it every day.
Tony knew this. He stood beside a wall and
began to beg.</p>

are not allowed in Pompeii. He crouched
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
beside a fence. When the guide's back was
turned, he slipped under the fence.</p>

<p>He was inside the gates. He was in Pompeii.
Really inside the gates of Pompeii!
Standing upon the long, silent streets, in the
shadow of stately ruins.</p>

<p>Columns and statues stood like graceful
ghosts. It was a place to impress any child.
To Tony, light-headed with fever, it was a
wonder and a dream.</p>

<p>A guide came along, leading a party of
tourists through the streets. To Tony his
voice droned like a swarm of bees.</p>

<p>"It was a city of pleasure and wealth,"
said the guide. "Tinkling fountains played.
Painted chariots clattered over the cobble-stones.
Boys and girls laughed and sang."</p>

<p>Tony saw it, felt it, heard it all!</p>

<p>"See the tracks of the chariots in the pavements,"
droned the guide's voice. "The
plumbing was so good that the fountains are
still running today."</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>

<p>Tony followed them through restored palaces,
courtyards, wine shops.</p>

<p>Some of the houses had four dining rooms&mdash;one
for each season: Spring, Summer,
Fall, and Winter. Before one house was the
word "Have." This means "Welcome" in
Greek. The Fascists say this when they
salute.</p>

<p>In the old Roman Bath was a case with
images like mummies. The guide entered
the building with his tourist train&mdash;a train
of human question marks.</p>

<p>Tony followed. He hid in a dark corner
so they would not see him.</p>

<p>"Here we have the forms of some of the
ancient people found in the ruins," explained
the guide. "They are, however, only hollow
forms. They have been surrounded by
lava."</p>

<p>"What is lava, Mama?" squeaked a tourist
child.</p>

<p>"Hush!" said the mother.</p>

<p>"I want some if it is to eat!" howled the
child.</p>

<p>"Lava," said the guide, "is the fiery fluid
which comes out of a volcano during an
eruption. When it cools it hardens and becomes
like rock."</p>

<p>"I don't want to eat any!" decided the
child.</p>

<p>"Here is the form of a dog," went on the
guide.</p>

<p>"I want a 'hot dog,' Mama!" whined the
child.</p>

<p>They finally left the building. Tony heard
the child's irritable voice far down the street.
He came out from his corner. The building
was empty.</p>

<p>He looked at the strange, rock-covered
images. The little dog was about the size
of Tina. He shivered. He went outside.
The sun had dropped behind a hill. He
could see Vesuvius puffing, puffing on her
pipe.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>

<p>"Oh, you&mdash;you wicked one!" He shook
his fist at the mountain.</p>

<p>His head began to spin. The streets were
more silent than ever, for the sight-seers
had all gone. Tall columns, like black
knights, stood guard over the buried city.</p>

<p>Tony had heard the guide say that at a
certain hour the gates would close. Was
that hour now past? Was he locked in the
deserted city, alone? Trapped, like victims
of the volcano so long ago?</p>

<p>He felt ill. He was burning with fever.
He started toward the gate, squeezing Tina
until she grunted.</p>

<p>Then, all at once, his legs seemed to disappear
beneath him and he sank to the earth.</p>

<p>The ruins of Pompeii whirled all about
him. Vesuvius blew a great column of
smoke in his face, and he knew no more!</p>

<h2>FEVER, FEAR, AND TROUBLED SLEEP</h2>


<p>The next thing Tony knew, he was in ancient
Pompeii. He was in the buried city before
it had been buried!</p>

<p>"How could this be?" you ask. "A person
cannot live in the past!"</p>

<p>Ah, but Tony had arrived upon a queer
ship. The name of the ship was <i>Fever, Fear,
and Troubled Sleep</i>.</p>

<p>Tony really and truly lay upon the ground
dreaming. He lay where he had fallen when
we last left him. But, in his dream, he was
in old Pompeii. Old Pompeii appeared to
him just as Anna's father and the guide had
told about it.</p>

<p>Tony believed that he lay in a corner of
the Forum, the main square of the town. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
was night, and a group of beggars slept beside
him. Tina cuddled snugly in his arms.</p>

<p>All about him slumbered Pompeii with the
smoke from Vesuvius curling above in the
black sky.</p>

<p>Tony looked up at the fire-mountain and,
all at once, his heart seemed to stand still.
Why, that volcano was going to destroy
Pompeii! It was written in books of history!
Everyone in the modern world knew it!</p>

<p>But here nobody knew it. How could
they? They were ancient people. He was
living in the past. Tony, the beggar boy,
was the only one who knew! He must tell
them!</p>

<p>He stood up. He saw those beautiful
homes and gardens he had heard so much
about. Tomorrow they would be in ruins!</p>

<p>Tomorrow? How did he know that the end
would come tomorrow? Tony could not explain.
But he did know. Dreams are like
that.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>

<p>He woke the beggars. He warned them
of the coming terror. Frantically he tried
to explain to them the danger of what was
about to happen.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>

<p>"Vesuvius will erupt and destroy Pompeii,"
he said.</p>

  <table border="0" cellpadding="0" width="550">

  </table>

<p>But the beggars laughed at him.</p>

<p>"Stuff!" said one.</p>

<p>"Liar!" cried another.</p>

<p>Then they went back to sleep.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>

<p>"You must believe me," cried poor Tony.
"Run away before it is too late!"</p>

<p>"Stop your silly talk," said one of the beggars.
"If you do not let us sleep, we shall
have you arrested as a mad sorcerer!"</p>

<p>Tony stole away with Tina under his arm.
There was only one thing for him to do. He
must wake the town.</p>

<p>Soon dawn would come. Then the mountain
would begin to shoot flames and the
whole city would rock.</p>

<p>He knocked at doors and tried to arouse
the people. But angry, sleepy voices told
him to go away. Nobody would believe him.</p>

<p>Tony began to wonder whether anyone
would ever believe him again. He had lied
so often. And now he was a thief besides!</p>

<p>He thought of little Anna. He had lied to
her and he had stolen her pet. He would be
punished by the fire-mountain for all his
wickedness!</p>

<p>But he and everyone else in Pompeii could
still be saved if they would only listen to him.</p>

<p>He began to cry out in the streets and to
run back and forth. A young Paul Revere!</p>

<p>"Awake! Awake! Vesuvius will erupt
today! Pompeii will be buried! Run and
save yourselves!" he cried.</p>

<p>"Go home to bed, stupid boy!" growled the
people.</p>

<p>But Tony would not go. He screamed
louder and louder.</p>

<p>"To jail with him," said someone. "He
must have an evil spirit!"</p>

<p>So poor Tony and his dream were thrown
into jail in ancient Pompeii.</p>

<p>Morning came. Over the top of the volcano
hung a dark cloud. The leaden sky
frowned down. Tony kicked at the bars of
the jail. He screamed. He pleaded. He
cried.</p>

<p>"Quiet, foolish child," said one of the
prison guards. "If you keep your peace, you
will be free tomorrow."</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>

<p>"There will be no tomorrow!" wailed poor
Tony. "Oh, believe me and let us all run!
Run from Pompeii!"</p>

<p>"Ha! Ha!" laughed the guard. "You are
only a lying little beggar! Nobody believes
lying little beggars!"</p>

<p>"But I am telling the truth!" insisted poor
Tony. "I am! I am! You must believe me!"</p>

<p>But it was useless.</p>

<p>As time went on the black cloud grew
larger. Suddenly, a great rumbling started.
An immense wall of fire-red stones came
crashing down the mountain, destroying
everything in its path.</p>

<p>The city was plunged into darkness. People
began screaming and running from their
houses. Everything rocked back and forth.</p>

<p>"Let me out!" cried Tony. "Oh, save me!
Madonna mia, never again will I lie or steal!
Oh, never! Save me! Save me!"</p>

<p>He held Tina tightly. She wriggled and
tried to break away. All at once she began
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
to squeal. He had never heard a dog squeal
like that!</p>

<p>Stones came hurtling against the prison
wall. Some entered through the bars and
hit Tony in the face. He closed his eyes. He
put up his arm to ward them off.</p>

<p>Then the roar of the mountain ceased and
the quaking of the earth stopped. But that
strange squealing went right on. A few
small pebbles still came flying.</p>

<p>He opened his eyes. The sun was shining.
The sky was blue overhead. Grey ruins lay
all about him. Old, old ruins! Tony was in
the modern world. He had awakened from
his dream!</p>

<p>But what was that something squirming
to break away from him? It was not Tina.
It felt fat and slippery and.... He looked.</p>

<p>He was holding, by one leg, a frisky, pink
pig! Its piteous shrieks filled the silent,
ruined city of Pompeii.</p>

<p>Where was Tina?</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>

<p>Just then, a shower of stones from a
near-by wall hit him. He turned. There was
Tina, standing upon the wall, digging with
her two busy, front paws. She was scattering
ruined Pompeii in Tony's eyes as fast as
she could scatter!</p>

<p>He freed the pink pig. It hurried off to
its neighboring farm, a wiser but sadder pig.
It would never again go sight-seeing!</p>

<p>"Here, Tina!" he called.</p>

<p>She stopped her morning's work. She
looked at her master.</p>

<p>"Good-morning," wagged her tail.</p>

<p>She jumped down into his arms and
started to lick his cheek.</p>

<p>"Oh, Tina, Tina," he sighed, as he hugged
her close. "All this time I have been asleep!
I have been dreaming about old Pompeii! It
was not true. It was a dream. Dio mio, how
happy I am!"</p>

<h2>TONY, ANNA, AND TINA</h2>


<p>Tony sat up and stretched. He felt very
weak but the fever had passed. The day
was young. Nobody stirred in the streets
of Pompeii. It was too early for the gates
to open.</p>

<p>Tony arose. "Come," he said to his dog.
"Let us go. We can crawl through the fence.
We shall have breakfast. Then, I know
what I shall do."</p>

<p>It was all so simple. It had come to him
quite suddenly. He must be a thief no
longer! He must take Tina back to Anna.
Tina was Anna's pet.</p>

<p>He bought some food for the dog. But
Tony himself could not eat. His heart ached.
He was going to lose his dear little friend.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>

<p>But it was the only thing to do. He saw
that now. He shuddered as he recalled his
horrible dream. Why, perhaps if he had
been a truthful boy the ancient people might
have believed him!</p>

<p>If they had believed him, think how many
lives could have been saved!</p>

<p>He suddenly laughed aloud.</p>

<p>"It was, after all, only a dream," he reminded
himself. "But I shall always remember
how terrible it is not to be believed!"</p>

<p>All morning he walked. Several times he
would have liked to stop, for his head felt
curiously light and his legs trembled. But
he was going to bring Tina back to Anna.
He could not be happy until he had done
that!</p>

<p>He approached Anna's house. It looked
so new and shiny. The flowers and trees
made a pretty frame for it. How different
from the ugly houses in the poor section of
Naples where he lived.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>

<p>It would be pleasant to wake up in the
morning and smell the fields and the Bay.
Not the horrible odors of narrow streets.
Dust and dirt and cooking things!</p>

<p>He must go bravely to the front door and
ring the bell. He must confess to Anna's
father all that he had done. He was ready
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
to take his punishment like a brave soldier
of Italy!</p>

<p>"Good-day."</p>

<p>The front door opened. Anna's mother
stood there with Anna close beside her.</p>

<p>When Anna caught sight of her pet, she
cried out, "Niki! Oh, I thought you were
lost! I thought the naughty boy had stolen
you! Come to me, Niki!"</p>

<p>She held out her arms. But Tony drew
Tina away from her. Why did his throat
feel so full and queer? Why did his nose
tickle and his eyes blur with tears?</p>

<p>No! No! He could not give up his Tina!
Anna had everything and he had only this
little dog! It was not fair.</p>

<p>He planted his poor, wobbly legs as sturdily
as he could. His dark eyes flashed at
the little girl.</p>

<p>"Do not touch her!" he cried. "She bites!"</p>

<p>Anna shrank back, afraid.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>

<p>"She is a bad dog!" continued Tony. "It
is not safe for you to keep her. She has
bitten me."</p>

<p>The mother went forward and gently
touched Tony's sleeve.</p>

<p>"Where has the dog bitten you, my poor
boy?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;on my back!" lied Tony.</p>

<p>"Turn around and let me see," said the
good woman.</p>

<p>But Tony did not turn around. Instead,
he fell upon his knees and clutched the skirt
of Anna's mother.</p>

<p>"I have lied again! Oh, forgive me!" he
sobbed. "What I just said was not true.
Tina does not bite. She is the gentlest little
dog that ever lived. And I am the greatest
liar!"</p>

<p>He was sobbing so that the woman could
hardly understand him. He tried hard to
explain everything that had happened to
him. But he felt weak and could barely talk.</p>

<p>Anna's mother raised him to his feet and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
led him to a bedroom. Here she undressed
him and prepared a bath.</p>

<p>At first this frightened Tony. There were
no bathrooms in the house where he had
lived! But somehow, he felt that this kind
woman would not hurt him. He allowed her
to bathe him and put him to bed.</p>

<p>He soon found himself tucked between
clean, cool sheets. The woman was offering
him something to drink. His eyes were closing.
Then he was asleep.</p>

<p>When he awoke it was late afternoon. The
window shades were drawn and the room
was fairly dark.</p>

<p>Tony lay gazing up at the smooth, white
ceiling. He felt well and strong now. He
thought that he loved the mother of Anna
better than anyone he had ever known. Yes,
better even than Tina!</p>

<p>How could he have lied to Anna again?
After promising himself that he would
change. After that terrible dream! Oh,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
surely that would be his last lie! Surely!</p>

<p>As he lay with his thoughts, the door
slowly opened. Anna peeped in. She held
Tina in her arms. When she saw Tony's eyes
open, she came into the room.</p>

<p>"I thought you would like to have Niki,"
she said.</p>

<p>She approached his bed. Tony held out
his arms for the dog.</p>

<p>"Her name is not Niki. It is Tina," he
said.</p>

<p>The little girl smiled.</p>

<p>"It is Niki," she repeated.</p>

<p>"Tina!" said Tony.</p>

<p>"Niki!" said Anna.</p>

<p>She was laughing now. So was Tony.</p>

<p>"Very well," he said. "Let us call her
'Fido.'"</p>

<p>"Fido" is taken from an Italian word
meaning "faithful."</p>

<p>So Anna put "Tina-Niki-Fido" into Tony's
arms and sat down beside him.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>

<p>"Papa says you are to stay here with us,"
she said.</p>

<p>Tony shot up in bed. A look of fear came
over his face.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>

<p>"But your papa will discipline me!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"No! No!" said Anna. "He says that
you must not be afraid of him. Discipline
does not hurt. It will make you happy to
grow up good."</p>

<p>Tony's eyes grew wide. So Anna's father,
with the deep voice, wanted to make him
happy!</p>

<p>"Papa has just been to see the Marionette
Man," went on Anna. "He told him all about
you, poor little boy!"</p>

<p>"And will I have to go back to Guido?"
asked Tony.</p>

<p>"No, never," replied Anna. "You are to
live with us, and Papa says you shall join the
Balilla."</p>

<p>Join the Balilla! Live in Anna's pretty
house! Never again be parted from his beloved
Tina! Oh, it was almost too good to be
true!</p>

<p>"But your father will punish me," he said,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
suddenly. He could not seem to forget the
gentleman's severe words.</p>

<p>"No, no," said Anna. "He says he thinks
you have been punished enough. He thinks
you will obey now and never lie again. Will
you promise, Tony?"</p>

<p>Tony hung his head. "I promise," he said.</p>

<p>"Papa always wanted a little boy of his
own," continued Anna. "He will be so proud
to have you march with the boys of Italy.
And I ... I would like a brother."</p>

<p>"Have you never had a brother?" asked
Tony.</p>

<p>"No," she answered, solemnly. "But I
once had a monkey!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>So Tony remained with Anna. He joined
the Balilla and he never lied or stole again.</p>

<p>Well, <i>almost</i> never. At first Anna's
father had to talk with him very seriously
to make him understand the beauty of
truth.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>

<p>When Anna grew a little older, she joined
the "Piccole Italiane," the girls' legion.</p>

<p>Tina-Niki-Fido did not join anything. At
least, I do not think she did. However, if
there is a "Bone-and-Biscuit Dog Scouts" in
Italy, you may be sure she became one.</p>

<p>She now belonged to both Tony and Anna.
Still, it was Tony who cared for her, fed her,
and slept with her.</p>

<p>You see, between Tony and Tina it had
been love at first sight!</p>
